              "'[Poems by William Blake 1789]\\n\\n \\nSONGS OF INNOCENCE AND OF EXPERIENCE\\nand THE BOOK of THEL\\n\\n\\n SONGS OF INNOCENCE\\n \\n \\n INTRODUCTION\\n \\n Piping down the valleys wild,\\n   Piping songs of pleasant glee,\\n On a cloud I saw a child,\\n   And he laughing said to me:\\n \\n \"Pipe a song about a Lamb!\"\\n   So I piped with merry cheer.\\n \"Piper, pipe that song again;\"\\n   So I piped: he wept to hear.\\n \\n \"Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;\\n   Sing thy songs of happy cheer:!\"\\n So I sang the same again,\\n   While he wept with joy to hear.\\n \\n \"Piper, sit thee down and write\\n   In a book, that all may read.\"\\n So he vanish\\'d from my sight;\\n   And I pluck\\'d a hollow reed,\\n \\n And I made a rural pen,\\n   And I stain\\'d the water clear,\\n And I wrote my happy songs\\n   Every child may joy to hear.\\n \\n \\n THE SHEPHERD\\n \\n How sweet is the Shepherd\\'s sweet lot!\\n From the morn to the evening he stays;\\n He shall follow his sheep all the day,\\n And his tongue shall be filled with praise.\\n \\n For he hears the lambs\\' innocent call,\\n And he hears the ewes\\' tender reply;\\n He is watching while they are in peace,\\n For they know when their Shepherd is nigh.\\n \\n \\n THE ECHOING GREEN\\n \\n The sun does arise,\\n And make happy the skies;\\n The merry bells ring\\n To welcome the Spring;\\n The skylark and thrush,\\n The birds of the bush,\\n Sing louder around\\n To the bells\\' cheerful sound;\\n While our sports shall be seen\\n On the echoing Green.\\n \\n Old John, with white hair,\\n Does laugh away care,\\n Sitting under the oak,\\n Among the old folk.\\n They laugh at our play,\\n And soon they all say,\\n \"Such, such were the joys\\n When we all -- girls and boys --\\n In our youth-time were seen\\n On the echoing Green.\"\\n \\n Till the little ones, weary,\\n No more can be merry:\\n The sun does descend,\\n And our sports have an end.\\n Round the laps of their mothers\\n Many sisters and brothers,\\n Like birds in their nest,\\n Are ready for rest,\\n And sport no more seen\\n On the darkening green.\\n \\n \\n THE LAMB\\n \\n   Little Lamb, who make thee\\n   Dost thou know who made thee,\\n Gave thee life, and bid thee feed\\n By the stream and o\\'er the mead;\\n Gave thee clothing of delight,\\n Softest clothing, wolly, bright;\\n Gave thee such a tender voice,\\n Making all the vales rejoice?\\n   Little Lamb, who made thee?\\n   Dost thou know who made thee?\\n \\n   Little Lamb, I\\'ll tell thee;\\n   Little Lamb, I\\'ll tell thee:\\n He is called by thy name,\\n For He calls Himself a Lamb\\n He is meek, and He is mild,\\n He became a little child.\\n I a child, and thou a lamb,\\n We are called by His name.\\n   Little Lamb, God bless thee!\\n   Little Lamb, God bless thee!\\n \\n \\n THE LITTLE BLACK BOY\\n \\n My mother bore me in the southern wild,\\n   And I  am black, but oh my soul is white!\\n White as an angel is the English child,\\n   But I am black, as if bereaved of light.\\n \\n My mother taught me underneath a tree,\\n   And, sitting down before the heat of day,\\n She took me on her lap and kissed me,\\n   And, pointed to the east, began to say:\\n \\n \"Look on the rising sun: there God does live,\\n   And gives His light, and gives His heat away,\\n And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive\\n   Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.\\n \\n \"And we are put on earth a little space,\\n   That we may learn to bear the beams of love\\n And these black bodies and this sunburnt face\\n   Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.\\n \\n \"For when our souls have learn\\'d the heat to bear,\\n   The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,\\n Saying, \\'Come out from the grove, my love and care\\n   And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice\\',\"\\n \\n Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;\\n And thus I say to little English boy.\\n When I from black and he from white cloud free,\\n And round the tent of God like lambs we joy\\n \\n I\\'ll shade him from the heat till he can bear\\n To lean in joy upon our Father\\'s knee;\\n And then I\\'ll stand and stroke his silver hair,\\n And be like him, and he will then love me.\\n \\n \\n THE BLOSSOM\\n \\n Merry, merry sparrow!\\n Under leaves so green\\n A happy blossom \\n Sees you, swift as arrow,\\n Seek your cradle narrow,\\n Near my bosom.\\n Pretty, pretty robin!\\n Under leaves so green\\n A happy blossom\\n Hears you sobbing, sobbing,\\n Pretty, pretty robin,\\n Near my bosom.\\n \\n\\n THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER\\n \\n When my mother died I was very young,\\n And my father sold me while yet my tongue\\n Could scarcely cry \"Weep! weep! weep! weep!\"\\n So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.\\n \\n There\\'s little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,\\n That curled like a lamb\\'s back, was shaved; so I said,\\n \"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for, when your head\\'s bare,\\n You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.\"\\n \\n And so he was quiet, and that very night,\\n As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight! --\\n That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,\\n Were all of them locked up in coffins of black.\\n \\n And by came an angel, who had a bright key,\\n And he opened the coffins, and let them all free;\\n Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run,\\n And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.\\n \\n Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,\\n They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind;\\n And the Angel told Tom, if he\\'d be a good boy,\\n He\\'d have God for his father, and never want joy.\\n \\n And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,\\n And got with our bags and our brushes to work.\\n Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm:\\n So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.\\n \\n \\n THE LITTLE BOY LOST\\n \\n \"Father, father, where are you going?\\n   Oh do not walk so fast!\\n Speak, father, speak to you little boy,\\n   Or else I shall be lost.\"\\n \\n The night was dark, no father was there,\\n   The child was wet with dew;\\n The mire was deep, and the child did weep,\\n   And away the vapour flew.\\n \\n \\n THE LITTLE BOY FOUND\\n \\n The little boy lost in the lonely fen,\\n   Led by the wandering light,\\n Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,\\n   Appeared like his father, in white.\\n \\n He kissed the child, and by the hand led,\\n   And to his mother brought,\\n Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,\\n   The little boy weeping sought.\\n \\n \\n LAUGHING SONG\\n \\n When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,\\n And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;\\n When the air does laugh with our merry wit,\\n And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;\\n \\n when the meadows laugh with lively green,\\n And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,\\n When Mary and Susan and Emily\\n With their sweet round mouths sing \"Ha, ha he!\"\\n \\n When the painted birds laugh in the shade,\\n Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:\\n Come live, and be merry, and join with me,\\n To sing the sweet chorus of \"Ha, ha, he!\"\\n \\n \\n A  SONG\\n \\n Sweet dreams, form a shade\\n O\\'er my lovely infant\\'s head!\\n Sweet dreams of pleasant streams\\n By happy, silent, moony beams!\\n \\n Sweet Sleep, with soft down\\n Weave thy brows an infant crown\\n Sweet Sleep, angel mild,\\n Hover o\\'er my happy child!\\n \\n Sweet smiles, in the night\\n Hover over my delight!\\n Sweet smiles, mother\\'s smile,\\n All the livelong night beguile.\\n \\n Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,\\n Chase not slumber from thine eyes!\\n Sweet moan, sweeter smile,\\n All the dovelike moans beguile.\\n \\n Sleep, sleep, happy child!\\n All creation slept and smiled.\\n Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,\\n While o\\'er thee doth mother weep.\\n \\n Sweet babe, in thy face\\n Holy image I can trace;\\n Sweet babe, once like thee\\n Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:\\n \\n Wept for me, for thee, for all,\\n When He was an infant small.\\n Thou His image ever see,\\n Heavenly face that smiles on thee!\\n \\n Smiles on thee, on me, on all,\\n Who became an infant small;\\n Infant smiles are his own smiles;\\n Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.\\n \\n \\n DIVINE IMAGE\\n \\n To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,\\n   All pray in their distress,\\n And to these virtues of delight\\n   Return their thankfulness.\\n \\n For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,\\n   Is God our Father dear;\\n And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,\\n   Is man, his child and care.\\n \\n For Mercy has a human heart\\n   Pity, a human face;\\n And Love, the human form divine;\\n   And Peace, the human dress.\\n \\n Then every man, of every clime,\\n   That prays in his distress,\\n Prays to the human form divine:\\n   Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.\\n \\n And all must love the human form,\\n   In heathen, Turk, or Jew.\\n Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell,\\n   There God is dwelling too.\\n \\n \\n HOLY THURSDAY\\n \\n \\'Twas on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,\\n Came children walking two and two, in read, and blue, and green:\\n Grey-headed beadles walked before, with wands as white as snow,\\n Till into the high dome of Paul\\'s they like Thames waters flow.\\n \\n Oh what a multitude they seemed, these flowers of London town!\\n Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own.\\n The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,\\n Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands.\\n \\n Now like a mighty wild they raise to heaven the voice of song,\\n Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among:\\n Beneath them sit the aged man, wise guardians of the poor.\\n Then

never can it be!\\n \\n He doth give his joy to all:\\n He becomes an infant small,\\n He becomes a man of woe,\\n He doth feel the sorrow too.\\n \\n Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,\\n And thy Maker is not by:\\n Think not thou canst weep a tear,\\n And thy Maker is not year.\\n \\n Oh He gives to us his joy,\\n That our grief He may destroy:\\n Till our grief is fled an gone\\n He doth sit

gambolled round\\n O\\'er the hallowed ground.\\n \\n Leopards, tigers, play\\n Round her as she lay;\\n While the lion old\\n Bowed his mane of gold,\\n \\n And her breast did lick\\n And upon her neck,\\n From his eyes of flame,\\n Ruby tears there came;\\n \\n While the lioness\\n Loosed her slender dress,\\n And naked they conveyed\\n To caves the sleeping maid.\\n \\n \\n THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND\\n \\n All the night in woe\\n Lyca\\'s parents go\\n Over valleys deep,\\n While the deserts weep.\\n \\n Tired and woe-begone,\\n Hoarse with making moan,\\n Arm in arm, seven days\\n They traced the desert ways.\\n \\n Seven nights they sleep\\n Among shadows deep,\\n And dream they see their child\\n Starved in desert wild.\\n \\n Pale through pathless ways\\n The fancied image strays,\\n Famished, weeping, weak,\\n With hollow piteous shriek.\\n \\n Rising from unrest,\\n The trembling woman presse\\n With feet of weary woe;\\n She could no further go.\\n \\n In his arms he bore\\n Her, armed with sorrow sore;\\n Till before their way\\n A couching lion lay.\\n \\n Turning back was vain:\\n Soon his heavy mane\\n Bore them to the ground,\\n Then he stalked around,\\n \\n Smelling to his prey;\\n But their fears allay\\n When he licks their hands,\\n And silent by them stands.\\n \\n They look upon his eyes,\\n Filled with deep surprise;\\n And wondering behold\\n A spirit armed in gold.\\n \\n On his head a crown,\\n On his shoulders down\\n Flowed his golden hair.\\n Gone was all their care.\\n \\n \"Follow me,\" he said;\\n \"Weep not for the maid;\\n In my palace deep,\\n Lyca lies asleep.\"\\n \\n Then they followed\\n Where the vision led,\\n And saw their sleeping child\\n Among tigers wild.\\n \\n To this day they dwell\\n In a lonely dell,\\n Nor fear the wolvish howl\\n Nor the lion\\'s growl.\\n \\n \\n THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER\\n \\n A little black thing in the snow,\\n Crying \"weep! weep!\" in notes of woe!\\n \"Where are thy father and

What can it mean?\\n And that I was a maiden Queen\\n Guarded by an Angel mild:\\n Witless woe was ne\\'er beguiled!\\n \\n And I wept both night and day,\\n And he wiped my tears away;\\n And I wept both day and night,\\n And hid from him my heart\\'s delight.\\n \\n So he took his wings, and fled;\\n Then the morn blushed rosy red.\\n I dried my tears, and armed my fears\\n With ten-thousand shields and spears.\\n \\n Soon my Angel came again;\\n I was armed, he came in vain;\\n For the time of youth was fled,\\n And grey hairs were on my head.\\n \\n \\n THE TIGER\\n \\n Tiger, tiger,

dread feet?\\n \\n What the hammer?  what the chain?\\n In what furnace was thy brain?\\n What the anvil? what dread grasp\\n Dare its deadly terrors clasp?\\n \\n When the stars threw down their spears,\\n And watered heaven with their tears,\\n Did he smile his work to see?\\n Did he who made the lamb make thee?\\n \\n Tiger, tiger, burning bright\\n In the forests of the night,\\n What immortal hand or eye\\n Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?\\n \\n \\n MY PRETTY ROSE TREE\\n \\n A flower was offered to me,\\n   Such a flower as May never bore;\\n But I said \"I\\'ve a pretty rose tree,\"\\n   And I passed the sweet flower o\\'er.\\n \\n Then I went to my pretty rose tree,\\n   To tend her by day and by night;\\n But my rose turned away with jealousy,\\n   And her thorns were my only delight.\\n \\n \\n AH SUNFLOWER\\n \\n Ah Sunflower, weary of time,\\n   Who countest the steps of the sun;\\n Seeking after that sweet golden clime\\n   Where the traveller\\'s journey is done;\\n \\n Where the Youth pined away with desire,\\n   And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,\\n Arise from their graves, and aspire\\n   Where my Sunflower wishes to go!\\n \\n \\n THE LILY\\n \\n The modest Rose puts forth a thorn,\\n The humble sheep a threat\\'ning horn:\\n While the Lily white shall in love delight,\\n Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright.\\n \\n \\n THE GARDEN OF LOVE\\n \\n I laid me down upon a bank,\\n   Where Love lay sleeping;\\n I heard among the rushes dank\\n   Weeping, weeping.\\n \\n Then I went to the heath and the wild,\\n   To the thistles and thorns of the waste;\\n And they told me how they were beguiled,\\n   Driven out, and compelled to the chaste.\\n \\n I went to the Garden of Love,\\n   And saw what I never had seen;\\n A Chapel was built in the midst,\\n   Where I used to play on the green.\\n \\n And the gates of this Chapel were shut\\n   And \"Thou shalt not,\" writ over the door;\\n So I turned to the Garden of Love\\n   That so many sweet flowers bore.\\n \\n And I saw it was filled with graves,\\n   And tombstones where flowers should be;\\n And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,\\n   And binding with briars my joys and desires.\\n \\n \\n THE LITTLE VAGABOND\\n \\n Dear mother, dear mother, the Church is cold;\\n But the Alehouse is healthy, and pleasant, and warm.\\n Besides, I can tell where I am used well;\\n The poor parsons with wind like a blown bladder swell.\\n \\n But, if at the Church they would give us some ale,\\n And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,\\n We\\'d sing and we\\'d pray all the livelong day,\\n Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.\\n \\n Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing,\\n And we\\'d be as happy as birds in the spring;\\n And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,\\n Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch.\\n \\n And God, like a father, rejoicing to see\\n His children as pleasant and happy as he,\\n Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel,\\n But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.\\n \\n \\n LONDON\\n \\n I wandered through each chartered street,\\n   Near where the chartered Thames does flow,\\n A mark in every face I meet,\\n   Marks of weakness, marks of woe.\\n \\n In every cry of every man,\\n   In every infant\\'s cry of fear,\\n In every voice, in every ban,\\n   The mind-forged manacles I hear:\\n \\n How the chimney-sweeper\\'s cry\\n   Every blackening church appals,\\n And the hapless soldier\\'s sigh\\n   Runs in blood down palace-walls.\\n \\n But most, through midnight streets I hear\\n   How the youthful harlot\\'s curse\\n Blasts the new-born infant\\'s tear,\\n   And blights with plagues the marriage-hearse.\\n \\n \\n THE HUMAN ABSTRACT\\n \\n Pity would be no more\\n If we did not make somebody poor,\\n And Mercy no more could be\\n If all were as happy as we.\\n \\n And mutual fear brings Peace,\\n Till the selfish loves increase\\n Then Cruelty knits a snare,\\n And spreads his baits with care.\\n \\n He sits down with his holy fears,\\n And waters the ground with tears;\\n Then Humility takes its root\\n Underneath his foot.\\n \\n Soon spreads the dismal shade\\n Of Mystery over his head,\\n And the caterpillar and fly\\n Feed on the Mystery.\\n \\n And it bears the fruit of Deceit,\\n Ruddy and sweet to eat,\\n And the raven his nest has made\\n In its thickest shade.\\n \\n The gods of the earth and sea\\n Sought through nature to find this tree,\\n But their search was all in vain:\\n There grows one in the human Brain.\\n \\n \\n INFANT SORROW\\n \\n My mother groaned, my father wept:\\n Into the dangerous world I leapt,\\n Helpless, naked, piping loud,\\n Like a fiend hid in a cloud.\\n \\n Struggling in my father\\'s hands,\\n Striving against my swaddling-bands,\\n Bound and weary, I thought best\\n To sulk upon my mother\\'s breast.\\n \\n \\n A POISON TREE\\n \\n I was angry with my friend:\\n I told my wrath, my wrath did end.\\n I was angry with my foe:\\n I told it not, my wrath did grow.\\n \\n And I watered it in fears\\n Night and morning with my tears,\\n And I sunned it with smiles\\n And with soft deceitful wiles.\\n \\n And it grew both day and night,\\n Till it bore an apple bright,\\n And my foe beheld it shine,\\n and he knew that it was mine, --\\n \\n And into my garden stole\\n When the night had veiled the pole;\\n In the morning, glad, I see\\n My foe outstretched beneath the tree.\\n \\n \\n A LITTLE BOY LOST\\n \\n \"Nought loves another as itself,\\n

I see they lay helpless & naked: weeping\\nAnd none to answer, none to cherish thee with mothers smiles.\\n\\nThe Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice & rais\\'d her pitying head:\\nShe bowd over the weeping infant, and her life exhald\\nIn milky fondness, then on Thel she fix\\'d her humble eyes\\n\\nO beauty of the vales of Har, we live not for ourselves,\\nThou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed:\\nMy bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark,\\n\\nBut he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head\\nAnd kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast.\\nAnd says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee\\nAnd I have given thee a crown that none can take away.\\nBut how this is sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know\\nI ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love.\\n\\nThe daughter of beauty wip\\'d her pitying tears with her white veil,\\nAnd said, Alas!  I knew not this, and therefore did I weep:\\nThat God would love a Worm I knew, and punish the evil foot\\nThat wilful bruis\\'d its helpless form: but that he cherish\\'d it\\nWith milk and oil I never knew, and therefore did I weep,\\nAnd I complaind in the mild air, because I fade away.\\nAnd lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot.\\n\\nQueen of the vales, the matron Clay answered: I heard thy sighs.\\nAnd all thy moans flew o\\'er my roof, but I have call\\'d them down:\\nWilt thou O Queen enter my house, tis given thee to enter,\\nAnd to return: fear nothing, enter with thy virgin feet.\\n\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nThe eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar:\\nThel enter\\'d in & saw the secrets of the land unknown;\\nShe saw the couches of the dead, & where the fibrous roots\\nOf every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists:\\nA land of sorrows & of tears where never smile was seen.\\n\\nShe wandered in the land of clouds thro\\' valleys dark, listning\\nDolors & lamentations: waiting oft beside the dewy grave\\nShe stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground,\\nTill to her own grave plot she came, & there she sat down.\\nAnd heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.\\n\\nWhy cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction?\\nOr the glistening Eye to the poison of a smile!\\nWhy are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn,\\nWhere a thousand fighting men in ambush lie!\\nOr an Eye of gifts & graces showring fruits & coined gold!\\n\\nWhy a Tongue impress\\'d with honey from every wind?\\nWhy an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?\\nWhy a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling & affright\\nWhy a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy?\\nWhy a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?\\n\\nThe Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek,\\nFled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har\\n\\n\\n'"
